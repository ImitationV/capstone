## Run it locally

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (Recommended version: Latest LTS) - You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn** (alternative package manager) - npm comes with Node.js, and you can install yarn separately from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (If you haven't already):**

    If you downloaded the project as a ZIP file, extract it to your desired location. If you cloned it using Git, skip this step.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

    Replace `your-project-directory` with the actual name of your project folder.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Use npm or yarn to install the project's dependencies:

    **Using npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    **Using yarn:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    This command will read the `package.json` file and install the necessary packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

#### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm run dev
```
